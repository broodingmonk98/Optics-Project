For the decay graph use values 0.01 and 0.0153 as the decay constants in the 
simply.py code, and for decayConst1 use 0.015 and 0.0153.

For the mirror graph, use mirror as 0.99 and 0.999

For the pump power graph use pump power as 1.3 and 1.2, notice the high difference in curves. For pump power graph 2 use values 1.3 and 1.4
