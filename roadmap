Excitation:
1)There will be spontaneous excitation through pump  ----Done
2)Excitation by stimulated photons, but this is included in gain term. ----4b
Generation of Photons:
1)There will be spontaneous emmission          ------1
2)Stimulated emmission, same phase, same direction.
Loss of Photons:
1)There will be loss at mirror			-----2:
2)Loss due to absorption by ground state atoms included in the gain term. ---4a
3)Photons at an angle, shall just go out of the gain medium. ------3
