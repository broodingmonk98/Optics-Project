# Optics-Project
IMPORTANT : Requirements to run the code : python3, matplotlib, numpy
Laser simulation (basic)
This is a project for our 1 credit photonics course.
In it we shall take inputs as the parameters of the laser, and output the effects produced.

EDIT 1:
The laser.py is not working, although nothing seems wrong with the logic. It is probably due to the equlibrium not being achieved since it depends very delicately on inputs.

EDIT 2:
The simply.py file is similar to a model of the laser, and captures only its very essence. Hence it is much simpler, and better to work with. There are three main parameters: 1) decay constant 2) mirror transperency 3) pump power
The output is very sensitive to these inputs as can be seen by the graphs.
